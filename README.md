# Macbeth

The Question:

The most common word greater than 4 characters in the play Macbeth is ‘Macbeth’ (Imagine that!). It appears 285 times.

Your challenge is to write a program that will read the ‘macbeth.txt’ file and find the SECOND MOST COMMON word greater than 4 characters in length in the play Macbeth.

To get the answer correct, you must account for the fact that the word is sometimes followed by the following punctation:

Comma, Period, Question Mark, Colon, Semi-colon, Exclamation Mark

To complete this challenge succesfully your program must:
1. Read the file ‘macbeth.txt’.
2. Eliminate all words that are 4 characters or less.
3. Account for words that are followed by puncutation.
4. Output the 2nd most common word and the number of times it appears.
